# R Mini Projects (R-SumProj)

This repository contains mini-assignments in R and Python covering basic data manipulation, statistical analysis, simulation, and visualization. Below is a brief summary of each assignment and a link to its folder.

- [Assignment1](Assignment1) — Basic R syntax: vectors, matrices, sequences, data frames, filtering and indexing.
- [Assignment2](Assignment2) — Data import and manipulation in R; filtering, averages, and grading logic.
- [Assignment3](Assignment3) — Excel import, missing data handling, weighted averages, and grading in R.
- [Assignment4](Assignment4) — Basic Python operations: vectors, matrices, sequences, and functions.
- [Assignment5](Assignment5) — Python data analysis with pandas: data frames, import, filtering, and weighted averages.
- [Assignment6](Assignment6) — Statistical tests in R and Python: variance tests, t-tests, and confidence intervals.
- [Assignment7](Assignment7) — Data visualization and descriptive analysis in R and Python (plots, histograms, boxplots).
- [Assignment8](Assignment8) — Multiple linear regression exercises in R and Python, prediction and intervals.
- [Assignment9](Assignment9) — Simulation studies and empirical power curves; sampling distributions and skewness analysis.
- [Assignment10](Assignment10) — Bootstrap analyses for percentiles and correlations in R and Python.
- [Assignment11](Assignment11) — Statistical modeling and visualization (R and Python solutions).
- [Assignment12](Assignment12) — Linear models, ANOVA, and Tukey comparisons in R and Python.

Notes
- Each folder contains code (R and/or Python) and a README with more details and how to run the scripts.
- Data files used by assignments are placed under `Datasets_UseCase/` and referenced from assignment READMEs where needed.
